# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given three classes in Python, titled GameExperience, TreasureHuntGame, and TreasureMaze. GameExperience contained the code for the experience replay, Treasuremaze contained the code for the environment, and TreasureHuntGame contained the Q-Learning method, qtrain, which was designed to train the method. The code that I created myself was contained within this method. The purpose of this method was to facilitate a repetition of epochs until a 100% win rate was achieved by the agent in reaching the goal. in so doing, the agent learned new and optimal pathways to take to find the treasure of the maze, first through environmental exploration, and then through exploitation of calculated strategies.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
In short, computer scientists solve problems, either for clients such as employers, or for themselves. It matters for many reasons, but probably the primary reason is that solving problems large and small, should ultimately be of benefit to society. This course centered on learning about AI systems, and the purpose of developing AI systems should be about developing tools which ultimately benefit society.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
This depends on the nature of the problem, and how complex it is. If the algorithm or program is to be short and not complex, then there usually isn't much planning involved. If the algorithm or program is to be complex and multi-faceted, then planning is usually involved along with the development of a blueprint or pseudocode before building of the program itself commences. Then, an iterative and agile approach is taken to the development process, wherein the program is tested frequently as fragments of code are added.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Transparency, honesty, and an unwavering work ethic applied to the best of my ability. Software development to the best of my knowledge, with the end user and the organization's requirements, standards and preferences always put first.
